This assignment serves to reinforce JavaScript syntax, functions, and some mathematical operators and sequences.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should:

* Understand general JavaScript syntax
* Grasp why functions are important
* Understand arrays and loops
* Be able to breakdown a simple process of mathematical steps into a series of statements in JavaScript

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should:

* Be able to demonstrate how to define a function with parameters and return the expected output
* Be able to effectively use console.assert

### Deliverables

A repo containing at least:

* index.html
* exercises.js
* refactor.js

### Requirements

* All functions should be complete and produce the expected output

#### GETTING STARTED

* Create a new repository
* Download starter files
* Link exercises.js and refactor.js in index.html

#### FOR EACH FUNCTION

* Fill in the function so that the console.assert() statements don't throw errors
